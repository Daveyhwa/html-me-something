           Hi, I am David Ardrey, and I am going to spew out words.

                <p>
                I am not a very good writer so be warned that this will not be some shakespearian prose.
                With that out of the way I am going to ramble my way through enough words to qualify the required length for this project I guess.
                I dont really know how many words have to be here but I am prepared to write them.
                If you read all the way through this you will probably take away little of value.
                </p>

                Hopefully, This picture of a puppy will help alleviate the pain of reading this seemingly random assortment of words.
                It really is a cute photo isn't it.
                If you are more of a cat person, don't fret. As I have more cute ammunition.

                Why not put on some relaxing music?
                 Clair de Lune is definitly a wonderful piece of music to put on this MySpace-esque web page
