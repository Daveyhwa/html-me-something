           Hi, I am David Ardrey, and I am going to spew out words.

                <p>
                I am not a very good writer so be warned that this will not be some shakespearian prose.
                With that out of the way I am going to ramble my way through enough words to qualify the required length for this project I guess.
                I dont really know how many words have to be here but I am prepared to write them.
                If you read all the way through this you will probably take away little of value.
                </p>

                Hopefully, This picture of a puppy will help alleviate the pain of reading this seemingly random assortment of words.
                It really is a cute photo isn't it.
                If you are more of a cat person, don't fret, as I have a cute kitten picture as well.
                </p>

                Why not put on some relaxing music?
                 Clair de Lune is definitly a wonderful piece of music to put on this MySpace-esque web page

                    Well you made it through this.
                    You made it through the slog of superflous verbage, designed to take up as much space on the page as much space up on the page as possible.
                    It was no easy feat but you have done it, and for that all I have to say is congratulations
                </p>
